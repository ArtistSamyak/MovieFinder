# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Finder Application

## 1. Introduction
Movie Finder is an iOS application built as part of a technical assessment. It demonstrates **MVVM architecture** within a **Clean Architecture** structure. The app consumes the [TMDb API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) to provide search and discovery of movies with elegant UI, caching, and modular navigation.

The codebase is divided into three layers: **Presentation**, **Domain**, and **Data** â€” each with distinct responsibilities.

### 2.1 Presentation Layer (UIKit)
- Implemented with **UIKit**.
- Follows the **MVVM pattern** with delegation for communication.
- Each `View` has a corresponding `ViewModel`.
- Navigation and dependency injection are handled by a **Flow Coordinator** using the factory pattern.

### 2.2 Domain Layer (Business Logic)
- Contains **entities**, **use cases**, and **repository protocols**.
- Business rules are encapsulated inside **Use Cases**, separate from UI and networking.
- Repository interfaces are defined here; the Data layer provides implementations.

### 2.3 Data Layer (Networking & Persistence)
- Networking implemented with **async/await**.
- **Network Service** fetches movie data from TMDb.
- **Core Data** is used for persistence and caching.
- An **Image Repository** manages downloading and caching of poster images.

---

## 3. Caching Mechanism
- Recently viewed movies are cached in **Core Data**.
- On app launch, a list of up to **10 most recently viewed** movies is displayed.
- Cache policy:
  - Most recently viewed appears first.
  - Oldest entry is evicted once limit is reached.
  - Cache size is configurable.

---

## 4. Networking Implementation
- Network Service performs all API requests.
- Designed with **dependency injection** for testability and flexibility.
- Error handling provides clear, user-friendly messages.

---

## 5. Flow Coordinator (Navigation)
- Centralizes navigation and dependency wiring.
- Acts as a **factory** for constructing the Search and Detail screens.
- Decouples UI logic from navigation concerns, keeping modules independent.
